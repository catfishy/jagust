He seemed to have some trouble tracking my questions at times (answering a question I had asked one or two questions ago, rather than the question I had just asked). I re-asked all the SCID screener questions that I had asked him during the first interview: he had different yes/no questions to 50% of them. When I gently challenged on these, noting he had different answers during our first conversation, at times he'd change his answer, at times he held fast to his current answer -- but regardless, the discrepancy in his report did not seem to bother him at all -- he evidenced a kind of ""belle indifference,"" and no real curiosity or concern that there was a difference over time in his report.

His Prednisone was increased and he was placed on a weaning dose. He was discharged after 2 days. Because of a WBC level of 12.1 and bacteria in the UA on screening, the subject was asked to return to the clinic for a repeat CBC and UA. The subject returned to the clinic on 12/9/2013 for a repeat UA and CBC. He reported his recent hospitalization at that time. During the exam, he was tachypneic at rest with pursed lip breathing. Breath sounds were distant and notable for marked rales and wheezes. He was pale. The results of the WBC level were higher at 13.5; the UA was clear. Despite a history of COPD, the subject continues to smoke. When medical records were received on 12/12/2013, it was noted the subject was also in the hospital from 11/2/2013 - 11/4/2013 for cellulitis from a cat bite and exacerbation of COPD.

I already scheduled his SCID/CAPS interview today for Saturday 6/18/2016, but there were a few  issues I wanted to check with you to see if it would be safe for him to move forward.  ADCS ID#: DA0274946Cohort: PTSD (unconfirmed)Clinic: Rush University Medical CenterItem/Question for SMR: (see below) -Participant had a liver transplant in 2006 oHe says this has been stable for the last 10 years[|239|][|130|][|167|]However [|226|][|128|][|156|]once in a while the level changes[|226|][|128|][|157|] and while he does take medication there is always a chance of rejection. oHe is taking tacrolimus 15mg, 2 pills in the morning and 1 pill at night since 2006[|239|][|130|][|167|]This is an  immunosuppressant oral medication that can prevent rejection after a transplant.[|239|][|130|][|167|] Px says he will have to take this for the rest of his life. [|239|][|130|][|167|]This medication is not on the medication tracker. Would taking this medication be okay? oHe sees his liver doctor every 6-8 months[|239|][|130|][|167|]The last time he saw his liver doctor was around Jan/Feb 2016 -Participant used to have hepatitis c oSaw that he was diagnosed with Chronic hepatitis C in his VA medical records oHe claims this has been [|226|][|128|][|156|]all gone[|226|][|128|][|157|] since 2014[|239|][|130|][|167|]He says he is no longer undergoing any treatment  oHe gets this checked twice a year[|239|][|130|][|167|]The last time this was checked was around Jan/Feb 2016. Based off this information, do you think Rush would be willing to accept this participant? Would this be something we should ask Dr. Weiner about? Thank you very much!

I see that you noted that the subject ""has 2 stainless steelstents in his heart that were placed in November 1, 2006 after a heartattack"". Is it possible to get a copy of the report to keep on file forMRI. They do like to have documentation in place that the stents arestainless steel and MRI safe. We have called and spoken with the subjecta few times and it sounds like he is getting a little frustrated that wehave not scheduled him yet, but we like to have everything in placebefore having the screening visit. I'm not sure the procedure was doneat the VA so you may not have access to it but if you could check on itthat would be great. If not we will follow up with him on the matter.Thank you for your help,David","2016-06-22 22:14:04.0"
