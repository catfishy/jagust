He seemed to have some trouble tracking my questions at times (answering a question I had asked one or two questions ago, rather than the question I had just asked). I re-asked all the SCID screener questions that I had asked him during the first interview: he had different yes/no questions to 50% of them. When I gently challenged on these, noting he had different answers during our first conversation, at times he'd change his answer, at times he held fast to his current answer -- but regardless, the discrepancy in his report did not seem to bother him at all -- he evidenced a kind of ""belle indifference,"" and no real curiosity or concern that there was a difference over time in his report.

His Prednisone was increased and he was placed on a weaning dose. He was discharged after 2 days. Because of a WBC level of 12.1 and bacteria in the UA on screening, the subject was asked to return to the clinic for a repeat CBC and UA. The subject returned to the clinic on 12/9/2013 for a repeat UA and CBC. He reported his recent hospitalization at that time. During the exam, he was tachypneic at rest with pursed lip breathing. Breath sounds were distant and notable for marked rales and wheezes. He was pale. The results of the WBC level were higher at 13.5; the UA was clear. Despite a history of COPD, the subject continues to smoke. When medical records were received on 12/12/2013, it was noted the subject was also in the hospital from 11/2/2013 - 11/4/2013 for cellulitis from a cat bite and exacerbation of COPD.
