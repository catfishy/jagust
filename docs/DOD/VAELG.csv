He says that he never got a reminder call. He says he has been trying to call the study today to find out if his interview was still on. After not hearing back from anyone at CIND, he decided to go to work, which is where he was when I called. He said he is working now and unable to do the interview. When I asked if we could have Laura call him to reschedule, he said he has second thoughts: he does not want to drive two hours one way to the clinic in Miami, and also expressed some concern about some of the procedures he would have to do (I didn't ask specifically, but assume the LP was the big one). He requested that we not reschedule the interview, but rather that we only call him at a later date to schedule an interview ""if you really badly need people.""","2013-09-08 02:06:14.0"
