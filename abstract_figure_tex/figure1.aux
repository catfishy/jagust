Each uptake pattern is broken down by uptake contribution per region, i.e. regional SUVR divided by summed SUVR across all brain regions, and thus the values in each row sum to 1. Uptake contributions range from 0.03 to 0.12, presented on a white (low) to blue (high) spectrum.}}{1}}

The black line represents predicted annual change by baseline SUVR. The colored points represent members of the pattern groups which exhibit significant effects on annualized change, despite correcting for non-pattern factors including baseline SUVR, age, sex, education, and Apoe4 status.}}{2}}
