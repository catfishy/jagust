A review of our telephone screening interview and the subject[|226|][|128|][|153|]s VA medical records are below:  1.During screening  and follow up calls after: participant said he had a TIA stroke in 2003 and confirmed multiple times that it was a TIA and NOT a major stroke.a.In 2003 TIA stroke symptoms started after Christmas and lasted a week: crossed eye vision, smile did NOT droop (could smile when asked by doctors), right side of face was numb but it was [|226|][|128|][|156|]surface numbness[|226|][|128|][|157|].b.3-4 days after initial symptoms, he saw a doctor then went to the ER where they found that his blood pressure was significantly high, had an MRI after and he was discharged the same day. c.The neurologist originally said it was a stroke, but 2-3 days after ER, the ER doctor said that nothing showed up in the MRI and it was probably a diabetic induced TIA. d.Participant was working at the time and had private insurance. Did not go to VA facility at the time [|226|][|128|][|147|] so we cannot see those medical records. Subject does not have those records.  2.Found in VA Medical Records: The notes are ambiguous.a.There is one instance where CVA is checked, but another note says that the stroke was a patient self-report. No formal clinical notes about either a TIA or stroke were found in his VA medical records.b.In his VA medical records, there is a note of an email this px sent to his PCP telling his PCP about the study and if she/he were to find anything that would make him unsafe for the study, he would discontinue his participation. His PCP responded that there does not seem to be any issues at this time for participant to participate.   Mike and Dr. Peskind, is it OK to refer this subject to the Seattle site?  From our review of the VA medical records and the subject[|226|][|128|][|153|]s comments, it seems like it was most likely a TIA.
